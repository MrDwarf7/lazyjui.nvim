# LazyJui.nvim

A Neovim plugin that provides a beautiful floating window interface for [jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj),
leveraging the [jjui](https://github.com/idursun/jjui) TUI for functionality.

## Features

- **Floating Window Interface** - Clean, distraction-free jjui experience
- **Fast Integration** - Seamless integration with your Neovim workflow
- **Customizable** - Configurable window size, borders, and behavior
- **Smart Window Management** - Auto-resize, focus handling, and proper cleanup
- **Health Checks** - Built-in dependency validation

## Prerequisites

- **Neovim** 0.7.0
- **[plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)** - Required dependency
- **[jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj)** - The VCS used with the plugin
- **[jjui](https://github.com/idursun/jjui)** - The TUI/tool that's spawned inside the floating window

## Installation & Configuration

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "mrdwarf7/lazyjui.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
  },
  keys = {
    {
      -- Default is <Leader>jj
      -- An example of a custom mapping to open the interface
      "<Leader>gj",
      function()
        require("lazyjui").open()
      end,
    },
  }
  opts =  {
    -- Optionally: 
    winblend = 69, -- If you want some level of transparency
    -- support for custom command pass-through
    -- In this example, we use the revset `all()` command 
    --
    -- Will default to just `jjui`
    cmd = { "jjui", "-r", "all()" }, 
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Commands

- `:LazyJui` - Open the LazyJui floating window

### API

```lua
local lazyjui = require("lazyjui")

-- Open the interface
lazyjui.open()

-- Close the interface
lazyjui.close()
```

### Health Check

Verify your installation and dependencies:

```vim
:checkhealth lazyjui
```

## Keymaps

The plugin sets a default keymap to open the interface.
You can customize it in your Neovim configuration:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>gj', ':lua require("lazyjui").open()<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Or the recommended way is to use the `keys` table in the plugin spec/configuration:

```lua
{
  "mrdwarf7/lazyjui.nvim",
  keys = {
    {
      "<Leader>gj",
      function()
        require("lazyjui").open()
      end,
    },
  }
}
```

## How It Works

LazyJui creates a floating window and spawns the `jjui` command inside it as a terminal job. The window:

- Automatically resizes when you resize Neovim
- Closes when you lose focus
- Properly cleans up resources to prevent memory leaks
- Integrates with plenary.nvim for enhanced window positioning when available

## Troubleshooting

### "jjui executable not found" error

Make sure you have the `jjui` command available & installed. It must be available on your PATH:

```bash
# Check if jjui is installed
which jjui

# Oh no!
```

```bash
# Follow the instructions on the official jjui repository 

# If using Arch for instance: 
paru -S jjui-bin # or yay
```

### Window positioning issues

If you're experiencing window positioning problems, make sure you have plenary.nvim installed. LazyJui uses plenary's advanced window positioning when available.
If you're still having problems with it, please open an issue with details about your Neovim version, OS, and any relevant configuration.

### Health check fails

Run `:checkhealth lazyjui` to diagnose issues. Common problems:

- Missing plenary.nvim dependency
- jjui not in PATH
- Neovim version too old
